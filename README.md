## Module 1

- We learnt how to write general and scenario based tests
- We also learnt using of "x" which skips the test from running

## Module 2

- We dove deeper into truffle configuration
- We learnt about deployment configuration for mainnet and rinkeby
- We learnt to setup configuration for deployment on loom testnet which is used for development and testing.
- We also learnt to deploy our contract on Basechain which is the mainnet, and for that we learnt to generate private keys.

## Module 3

- We learnt to setup an oracle which basically communicates with external API for example to get the value of ether in terms of dollars
- We learnt to delete mappings once they are not needed for example the request has been processed and is no longer of use.
